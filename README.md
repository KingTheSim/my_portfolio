# my_portfolio
The repository for my portfolio website. It will probably be broken 75% of the time until I figure what and how to use.

Initial commit 29.11.2023
Uploading the unfinished skeleton of my first iteration of the portfolio website. The idea is to use PostgreSQL as a database, with Python with the Django framework as an API back-end and have a front-end, composed of Rust with the Yew framework and some HTMX in the index.html. I am unaware at the moment if I'll get it to work or if  I will even use these technologies till the end. Yet, I believe it'll be a nice learning experience.
